The data provided here consists of ml.txt, which is the raw data of significant genes used for the machine learning algorithms.
I also included the raw data for the patients which I have preprocessed, in folders TMA and TWA. These are for included samples.
Excluded folder is for samples excluded from the study.
I also attached figures used in the study, as well as the code I used to reach all the conclusions available in the article.

Moreso, I inserted here all supplementary materials with various results. In the case you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
